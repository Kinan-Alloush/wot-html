    <h1>Top Ten Mistakes of Web Design</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Since my first attempt in 1996, I have compiled many top-10 lists of the biggest mistakes in Web design. 
        See links to all these lists at the bottom of this article. 
        This article presents the highlights: the very worst mistakes of Web design. (Updated 2011.)
    </p>

    <h2>1. Bad Search</h2>
    <p>
        Overly literal search engines reduce usability in that they're unable to handle typos, plurals, hyphens, and other variants of the query terms. 
        Such search engines are <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-for-senior-citizens/">particularly difficult for elderly users</a>, but they hurt everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
        A related problem is when search engines prioritize results purely on the basis of how many query terms they contain, rather than on each document's importance. 
        Much better if your search engine calls out "best bets" at the top of the list — especially for important queries, such as the names of your products. 
        Search is the user's lifeline when navigation fails. Even though advanced search can sometimes help, 
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-visible-and-simple/">simple search usually works best</a>, and search should be presented as a simple box, since that's what users are looking for.
    </p>

    <h2>2. PDF Files for Online Reading</h2>
    <p>
        Users hate coming across a PDF file while browsing, because it breaks their flow. 
        Even simple things like printing or saving documents are difficult because standard browser commands don't work. 
        Layouts are often optimized for a sheet of paper, which rarely matches the size of the user's browser window. 
        Bye-bye smooth scrolling. Hello tiny fonts. Worst of all, PDF is an undifferentiated blob of content that's hard to navigate. 
        PDF is great for printing and for distributing manuals and other big documents that need to be printed. 
        Reserve it for this purpose and convert any information that needs to be browsed or read on the screen into real web pages.

        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pdf-unfit-for-human-consumption/">PDF is bad for online reading</a>.

    <h2>3. Not Changing the Color of Visited Links</h2>
    <p>
        A good grasp of past navigation helps you understand your current location, since it's the culmination of your journey. 
        Knowing your past and present locations in turn makes it easier to decide where to go next. 
        Links are a key factor in this navigation process. Users can exclude links that proved fruitless in their earlier visits. 
        Conversely, they might revisit links they found helpful in the past. 
        Most important, knowing which pages they've already visited frees users from unintentionally revisiting the same pages over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
        These benefits only accrue under one important assumption: that users can tell the difference between visited and unvisited links because the site shows them in different colors. 
        When visited links don't change color, users exhibit more navigational disorientation in usability testing and unintentionally revisit the same pages repeatedly.

    </p>

    <h2>4. Non-Scannable Text</h2>
    <p>
        A wall of text is deadly for an interactive experience. Intimidating. Boring. Painful to read. 
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/topic/writing-web/">Write for online</a>, not print. 
        To draw users into the text and support scannability, use well-documented tricks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subheads</li>
        <li>Bulleted lists</li>
        <li>Highlighted keywords</li>
        <li>Short paragraphs</li>
        <li>The inverted pyramid</li>
        <li>A simple writing style</li>
        <li>De-fluffed language devoid of marketese</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>5. Fixed Font Size</h2>
    <p>
        CSS style sheets unfortunately give websites the power to disable a Web browser's "change font size" button and specify a fixed font size. 
        About 95% of the time, this fixed size is <i>tiny</i>, reducing readability significantly for most people over the age of 40. 
        Respect the user's preferences and let them 
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/let-users-control-font-size/">resize text</a> as needed. 
        Also, specify font sizes in relative terms — not as an absolute number of pixels.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Page Titles With Low Search Engine Visibility</h2>
    <p>
        Search is the most important way users discover websites. Search is also one of the most important ways users find their way around individual websites. 
        The humble page title is your main tool to attract new visitors from search listings and to help your existing users to locate the specific pages that they need.
    </p>
    <p>
        The page title is contained within the HTML &lt;title&gt; tag and is almost always used as the clickable headline for listings on search engine result pages (SERP). 
        Search engines typically show the first 66 characters or so of the title, so it's truly 
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microcontent-how-to-write-headlines-page-titles-and-subject-lines/">microcontent</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Page titles are also used as the default entry in the Favorites when users bookmark a site. 
        For your homepage, begin with the company name, followed by a brief description of the site. 
        For other pages, start the title with a few of the most salient information-carrying words that describe the specifics of what users will find on that page.
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tagline-blues-whats-the-site-about/">Taglines on homepages</a> are a related subject.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement</h2>
    <p>
        Selective attention is very powerful, and Web users have learned to stop paying attention to any ads that get in the way of their goal-driven navigation. 
        Unfortunately, users also <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/fancy-formatting-looks-like-an-ad/">ignore legitimate design elements</a> that look like ads. 
        Therefore, it is best to avoid any designs that look like advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/">Banner blindness</a> means that users never fixate on anything that looks like a banner ad, 
        and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/will-plain-text-ads-continue-to-rule/">text-only search-engine ads</a> are the main exception.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Violating Design Conventions</h2>
    <p>
        Consistency is one of the most powerful usability principles: when things always behave the same, users don't have to worry about what will happen. 
        Instead, they know what will happen based on earlier experience. 
        Jakob's Law of the Web User Experience states that "users spend most of their time on other websites." 
        This means that they form their expectations based on what's commonly done elsewhere. 
        If you deviate, your site will be harder to use and users will leave.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Opening New Browser Windows</h2>
    <p>
        Opening new browser windows is annoying and confuses users, especially when the Back button becomes disabled. 
        Links should simply replace the current page with new content. 
        Users hate unwarranted pop-up windows. Let them choose to open new windows themselves.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Not Answering Users' Questions</h2>
    <p>
        Users are highly goal-driven on the Web. They visit sites because there's something they want to accomplish — maybe even buy your product. 
        The ultimate failure of a website is to fail to provide the information users are looking for. 
        Sometimes the answer is simply not there, and you lose the sale.
    </p>
    <p>
        The worst example of not answering users' questions is to 
        <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/show-price/">avoid listing the price</a> of products and services. 
        Price is the most specific piece of information customers use to understand an offering. 
        Not showing it makes people feel lost and reduces their understanding of your products.
